General:

Get rid of panel names
Reorganize panels- sphere, chord, beeswarm on the top, and network, bias on the bottom
Hide the panel resizing icon unless moused over
Make sure when you hover on a point in 1 panel, it gets highlighted correspondingly in other panels
Minimum font size overall is the size that you have for your selected/focused task textboxes rn
All numbers on the I/f or in tooltips need to have a max of 3 decimal places
Throughout the interface, follow conventional of task_1-task_9, selected_task in your axes labels 


Sphere:

Change toggle to a dropdown
Increase tooltip opacity
Have a minimizable box with a legend for all the points (as a scrollable div)
The sphere zoom and pan controls need to be specified in gray text
On hover:
Thick black border
Opacity 1 for all points of same color
Opacity 0.8 or lesser for different colored points
On click:
Highlight border 
Opacity 1
Rest grayscale


Network:

Color points based on similarity from selected task (mono/bi-chromatic linear scale)
Can have options to select different color legends in a drop down
Modify the threshold a bit to prevent it from looking like a hub center node- there should be links between the nearest neighbors as well
Increase opacity on hover for the other tasks so the network remains visible- not seen rn
Also on hover and select- display the task ID in the corner of the panel (ie., task_1 - task_9, selected_task)
Make the focused task only appear on mouseover
Text areas:
The text areas are going to have 4 tabs- definition, positive examples, negative examples, instances
Have an “update” button for the first 3- modification of existing text
The instances text area should show up blank- so you have “add” there instead
By default, the selected task text area has a white bg, and the focused task one has a darker background, to indicate that the task being worked on is selected
On click of the focused task in the network, reverse the highlighting (on click again the selected task is back as the main thing)
Decimals max 3 places, and say explicitly that Semantic Textual Similarity value is being shown


Beeswarm:

Decrease node sizes
Black outline for selected task
For focus task hovering, decrease the opacity of the focused hover to 1, selected to 0.8, rest of the tasks to 0.6
Color based on network graph color scale
Labels for the axes
Have a dummy dropdown to show selected model as GPT_3
On hover of the instance, it would be good to display the instance text in a textarea instead of the tooltip (optional)


Chord:

Recolor based on network 
Highlighting similar to beeswarm
Have a threshold for chord generation so it doesn’t look that dense
Show the value of chord on hover
Have 2 dropdowns:
Correlation metric (choice of performance/sts/embedding distance/ etc.)
Definition/PE/NE


Bias:

In the dropdown, make the metric names more understandable
Show numerical values in the tooltip on hover
Bar
Axes size and labeling
Heatmap
Make sure color scale doesn’t clash with network colors
Box
Should have the instance highlighted in the beeswarm
Should have the examples shown somewhere too
Extra Dropdown:
PE/NE/Instance/Definition
Colors must correspond to other panels
Adding a new instance or modifying something- bold the outline of that and slightly increase the size, and then transition to normal representation (so it pops out for a second then fades to normalcy)
